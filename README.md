# LINUX CONFIG AUTOMATION

## Description
This repository includes a script that installs the main tools I use on a Linux environment, configuration files for some of these tools when necessary, and some of my Ubuntu setup (theme, dock, etc...).
Following, the list of installed software by alphabetical order:
- Curl
- Discord
- Fetch
- Fzf
- Git
- Google Chrome
- NgRok
- Nord VPN
- Nvm
- Terminator
- Thunderbird
- Virtualbox
- Vlc
- Vokoscreen
- VSCode
- WGet
- Zoom
- Zsh

## How it works
After a fresh Linux install, download the project in your computer and run the file `install.sh` to run the install.

## Troubleshooting
It appears that an issue prevents a proper Slack installation with the `apt` package 'slack'. I don't want to add any Snap install in the repository so it up to you to use the tool of your choice. Yo can still use `apt` with the Slack `.deb` package provided on their [website](https://slack.com/intl/en-gb/downloads/linux).
